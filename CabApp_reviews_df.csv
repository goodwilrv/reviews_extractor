0,"  I love this app i use this almost everyday for my commute,Uber pool is much affordable and routes and matching are most of the time efficient and prefect,Some time the pool get matched far off.Drivers are good and kind. Some time GPS confuse the drivers in terms of drop off locations or pickup location. The new driver's profile are catchy and briefly show some information about the drivers.I hope uber will create riders profile too.Thank you.  ","  Good application. I am a frequent traveller through OLA shuttle for to and from office. i would like to have little more frequency in shuttle service option from Patuli kolkata to esospace rajarhat. currently there is a gap of 1hr 30 min from 8:30 am to 10:17 am. can u please provide some more shuttle in between this time in this route. Also try to have more micro and mini available all the time. When commuters need service more in peak hours,  those just vanish. Kindly have thought.  ",  E-mail reciepts not working...

1,"  Trying to help my sister reach her destination, the drivers cancelled and didn't charge me the cancellation fee but instead the price of the whole fare. Now I'm trying to find the company/corporate number to get my money back. But it doesn't show a number to contact. Uber is trying to be slick now but it's not. I don't recommend it if you are new to it. Learn to use it first.  ",  Nice service but in Tirunelveli in ola Auto charge more than bill that is equal to normal stand Auto bill. When we call driver after getting booking confirmed they telling their rate. If we agree they are ready to pickup otherwise they are telling customers to cancel the ride. Other than this your service is nice and app function well. Please provide some provision for complaint in app  ,  Good app. Payment with wallet sometimes doesn't happen  
2,"  Fare cheat...!! The driver took different route and makes my trip fare goes thrice than it should be. And the best of it, uner says : it is within fare range... so I cannot do anything against this.... the driver said he knows the route so I do not check my GPS... but I realised when it took longer and the driver seems to circling around... its too late...anyway.. my 3Km trips become 12Km... and UBER PROTECTING THIS CHEATER!!!

5,  Ok seriously uber need to work on a lot. Mainly the language barrier! You should not match up English and Spanish speaking people if they are unable to communicate with one another. It's fustrating especially at an AIRPORT. There is a lack of communication! If a driver says they only speak a certain language do not match them with someone that doesn't understand that language unless its an easy to navigate place.  ,"  Worst kind of pricing i have ever seen. If the ride has been cancelled by the driver then its a problem with him, not with a rider. I was really pissed off because of this over charge. I think they should let us allow the customers to know about the actual fare amount before starting a ride. Please update your app properly. Didn't expect this kind of faulty service from Ola. Worse service.  ","  Just pathetic. Never go by the fare estimator as it is faulty, you would end up paying close to 1.5-2 times of the shown fare. There app is not capable of deducting the amount from your wallet so in the end you have to pay cash to the driver as according to customer care at 3 am in the morning they expect us to find an ATM and give cash since their system had a fault and wallet was not deducted. Ended up paying 900/- for the ride which was showing an estimate of 500/-.  Dumbest and stupidest customer care ever. All they can say is ""sorry I can't help you in this regard"".  "

1181,  Ok seriously uber need to work on a lot. Mainly the language barrier! You should not match up English and Spanish speaking people if they are unable to communicate with one another. It's fustrating especially at an AIRPORT. There is a lack of communication! If a driver says they only speak a certain language do not match them with someone that doesn't understand that language unless its an easy to navigate place.  ,"  Worst kind of pricing i have ever seen. If the ride has been cancelled by the driver then its a problem with him, not with a rider. I was really pissed off because of this over charge. I think they should let us allow the customers to know about the actual fare amount before starting a ride. Please update your app properly. Didn't expect this kind of faulty service from Ola. Worse service.  ","  Just pathetic. Never go by the fare estimator as it is faulty, you would end up paying close to 1.5-2 times of the shown fare. There app is not capable of deducting the amount from your wallet so in the end you have to pay cash to the driver as according to customer care at 3 am in the morning they expect us to find an ATM and give cash since their system had a fault and wallet was not deducted. Ended up paying 900/- for the ride which was showing an estimate of 500/-.  Dumbest and stupidest customer care ever. All they can say is ""sorry I can't help you in this regard"".  "
